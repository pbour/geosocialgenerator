# Geosocial Network Generator

This repository provides the implementation for the paper "Towards Generating Realistic Geosocial Networks", which presents three combiners that build different types of geosocial networks.

## Dependencies

This project depends on the following Python package and spatial graph generator:

- [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/): A Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks.
 
- [SPIDER](https://github.com/aseldawy/spider): A Spatial Data Generator for creating synthetic spatial datasets.
